# parenthetical
### Markup allows Text Documents to be read at varying levels of detail


# Language Outline: Parenthetical

* Annotate everything with nested parentheses and render similar to markdwown
* use lighter and light color grey text to indicate deeper depth
* bibliographic references can be pulled in place and still represented with [23] annotation
    * references are also nice to have in one place, this seems to indicate a need for link pulling context like an 'include' statement
    * this might also be a way of breaking up really deeply nested stuff onto its own page, etc
* being able to pull and embed content via hyperlink scraping could be a great way of reading wikipedia
    * you can pull in the first level definition of any hyperlinked word, then expand by section if you want

#### Uses:
* Science class
* Wikipedia
* life story
* write down ideas
* story snowflake method
* teaching language => combine with 1,000 words project  
* presentation: slide creation from outlines, render at differing levels of detail  
    * presenter notes can be depth +1 of the displayed slides  
* cliff notes and movie synopses
* study material
